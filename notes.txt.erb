Rails Yayyyyyyy

	THE RAILS WAY

Convention vs Configuration
 	"Do it our way or it will be very hard for you..."
 	"But do it our way, and it will be relatively easy.."

 	-Business Logic vd UI (Very close to user/problem domain)
 	-DRY as FUCK
 	-Test
 	-Modular(gems)

MVC

-Routes-Point to a method inside of the controller
-Controller manipulates the data and invokes the view
-The view is the response

Model:
	-The model IS NOT the database itself, it only connected
	-Singular

Controller:
	-Calls some methods, prepares some data, prepares the view to be sent back to client
	-One controller manages one resource (usually a model) all the CRUD

View:
	-Represents different resources in different formats (CSV PDF Json Javascript HTML etc)

MUST learn 3 things:
	-MVC
	-Rails
	-Rails gems

 Form_Tag's

<%= form_tag("/search"), do %>

<%= label_tag (:q, "Search for") %>

<%= text_field_tag(:q) %>
    -When using form_tag, other attr will generally have _tag at the end.

<%= submit_tag("search") %>
    -This form is currently set to post. In rails, it automatically sets to that. You must change
    to get!!!
   CHANGE: <%= form_tag("/search", method: "get") do %>

 <% end %>
