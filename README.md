Photogur
========
Photogur is the first Rails assignment I completed while I was at bitmaker labs. It is very simple and straight forward in terms of its database design and functionality but it was good practice. Basically, it saves and displays images with a title and caption. It does not have any styling so I did what I could with html. The finished project is [deployed](http://enigmatic-woodland-3962.herokuapp.com/) on heroku.
